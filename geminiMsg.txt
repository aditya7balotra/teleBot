i want you to give me the possible movie name or series name from the data i have provided in the json format.

actually the response you are going to provide me is going to be saved in the database , so i want you to give answer only in the specified format of json
.Also one more thing, please write numbers without zeroes in the left like for 01 give me 1, for maybe 087, give me 87 instead
.Also do not include punctuation marks in names of movies and series
.Also don't write roman number like for iron man II give me name iron man 2 instead
here is the format:
 {
    ismovie: 1 if its a movie or 0 if not
    movie: Null if its a series and not a movie or {
        name: name of the movie
        year : null if not in the data i provided
        quality: null if not in the data i provided(just write the main part like 1080p  240p etc )
        language: null if not in the data
        subtitle: null if not in the data
    } if its a movie,
    series: null if its not a series or {
        name: name of the series
        season: season of the series
        episode: complete if not given in the data
        year: null if not in the data
        quality: null if not in the data(just write the main part like 1080p  240p etc )
        language: null if not in the data
        subtitle: null if not in the data

    } if its a series
 }
